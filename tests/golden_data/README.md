# Golden Test Data

This directory contains reference outputs used for regression testing.
Tests verify that current outputs match these golden files via SHA256 checksums.

## Purpose

Golden files lock down exact behavior to prevent unintended changes:
- Coordinate conversion stability
- Filtering consistency
- Output format preservation

## Tests Support Parallel Execution âœ¨

Golden tests now run in **parallel** (default behavior) thanks to path-independent checksumming:

```bash
cargo test test_golden  # Runs in parallel automatically!
```

**How it works:**
- ONEview (bundled with fastga-rs build) converts .1aln binary to text
- Filter out path-dependent lines: `!` (provenance) and `<` (headers containing directory paths)
- Sort output to handle non-deterministic FastGA multithreading
- Compute checksum of normalized output
- Each test uses unique temp directories without conflicts

This was previously impossible because .1aln format embeds absolute directory paths in `<` header lines.

## Files

- `checksums.txt` - SHA256 hashes of all golden outputs
- `*.1aln` - Binary .1aln reference files
- `*.paf` - Text PAF reference files
- `generate_golden.sh` - Script to regenerate golden files (use with caution!)

## Regenerating Golden Files

**WARNING**: Only regenerate when intentionally changing behavior!

```bash
cd tests/golden_data
./generate_golden.sh
```

This updates all golden files and checksums. Commit the changes with a clear
explanation of why output changed.

## CI Behavior

GitHub Actions CI **skips** golden tests (via `--skip test_golden`) because:
- ONEview is not available in CI environment
- Golden tests require building release binary first
- These tests are intended for local validation before commits

The test `test_golden_files_complete` always runs to verify that `checksums.txt` exists and has all required entries.

## Test Failure

If golden tests fail:

1. **Expected failure**: You changed filtering/coordinates intentionally
   - Review the diff carefully
   - Regenerate golden files
   - Update CHANGELOG.md explaining the change

2. **Unexpected failure**: You introduced a regression
   - Revert your changes
   - Fix the bug
   - Tests should pass again

## Checksum Format

```
<sha256> <filename>
```

Example:
```

```
