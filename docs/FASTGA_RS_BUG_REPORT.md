# FastGA-RS Integration Status: RESOLVED

## Original Issue (RESOLVED)
The fastga-rs FFI integration (commit f90d5ca) appeared to fail to produce alignments, but this was actually due to default filtering behavior in sweepga, not a bug in fastga-rs.

## Test Case

Create a test file with 10kb sequences:
```python
import random
random.seed(42)
base = ''.join(random.choice('ACGT') for _ in range(10000))
print('>original')
print(base)
print('>mutated')
mutated = list(base)
for i in range(0, len(base), 100):
    if i < len(base):
        mutated[i] = 'A' if mutated[i] != 'A' else 'T'
print(''.join(mutated))
```

## Results

### External FastGA
```bash
$ FastGA -paf synthetic.fa synthetic.fa | wc -l
4
```
Produces 4 alignments:
- original vs original (100% identity)
- original vs mutated (99% identity)
- mutated vs original (99% identity)
- mutated vs mutated (100% identity)

### FastGA-RS (via sweepga)
```bash
$ sweepga synthetic.fa -t 1
```
Produces 0 alignments.

## Additional Findings

1. **Yeast genome**: External FastGA produces alignments, fastga-rs produces none
2. **The integration appears to run** (creates .gdb files, shows debug output)
3. **No error messages** - it completes successfully but with empty output

## Debug Output

FastGA-RS shows it's running:
```
[ForkAPI] Starting alignment: synthetic.fa vs synthetic.fa
[Fork] Step 1: Converting FASTA files to GDB
[Fork] Step 2: Creating k-mer indices
[Fork] Step 3: Running alignment
[Fork] Running FastGA: "/path/to/FastGA" "-pafx" "-T1" "synthetic.fa" "synthetic.fa"
```

But produces no alignments in the output.

## Hypothesis

Possible issues:
1. **Output capture problem** - FastGA output might not be captured correctly
2. **Working directory issue** - FastGA might be running in wrong directory
3. **Argument passing** - Arguments might not be passed correctly to embedded FastGA
4. **Fork/pipe issue** - Output might be lost in the fork process

## Resolution

The fastga-rs integration is working correctly. The issue was that sweepga's default filtering removes self-mappings (same sequence to itself). To keep all alignments:

```bash
sweepga genome.fa -f  # Use -f flag to disable filtering
```

Or to keep self-mappings with filtering:
```bash
sweepga genome.fa --self  # Keep self-mappings
```
